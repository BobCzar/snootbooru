<p class='section' id='inappropriate-imagery-depicting-minors'><strong>Inappropriate Imagery Depicting Minors</strong></p>

<p>Definition of Minors: For the purposes of this rule, a "minor" refers to any character that is depicted with a body shape and proportions consistent 
with prepubescent or early adolescent individuals. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Individuals appearing under the age of 18. Snootbooru has final say on what constitutes these descriptions. Merely stating that the character depicted 
    is an adult is not sufficient grounds for permitting content that would otherwise violate this policy.</li>
    <li>Determining Body Type: When assessing whether an image features a minor, we consider the following characteristics: Body Proportions: Features 
    such as a lack of secondary sexual characteristics (e.g., minimal breast development, absence of muscular definition, shorter stature).</li>
    <li>Facial Features: Youthful facial traits, such as round cheeks and a lack of pronounced jawlines or mature features.</li>
    <li>Clothing and Context: Contextual clues in clothing style or setting that suggest a childlike or adolescent environment.</li>
    <li>Prohibited Content: Images depicting minors (according to the above definitions) in sexualized, violent, or otherwise inappropriate contexts—including 
    but not limited to: nudity, sexual acts, implied sexual acts, sexually persuasive positions, graphic violence, lolicon/shotacon, or compromising positions.</li>
